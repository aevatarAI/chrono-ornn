# Ornn Releases

## v0.1.3 — Core Skills & Multi-Platform Agent Support (Current)

This release introduces Ornn Core Skills — three foundational skills that teach AI agents how to discover, create, and upload skills on the Ornn platform. It also adds prompt-based installation support for multiple agent platforms.

### What's New

1. **Ornn Core Skills** — Three skills shipped in the `ornn-core-skills/` directory:
   - `ornn-search-and-run` — Discover, pull, and execute skills from the Ornn library via NyxID MCP
   - `ornn-upload` — Package and upload skills to the Ornn registry (with proper root folder ZIP structure and base64 body encoding)
   - `ornn-build` — Generate complete skill packages from natural language descriptions using AI (single-turn and multi-turn refinement)

2. **Prompt-Based Installation** — Users can install core skills by pasting a single prompt into their AI agent. No scripts or manual setup required. Replaces the previous `setup.sh` script approach.

3. **Multi-Platform Support** — Installation prompts for four agent platforms:
   - **Claude Code** — Skills in `.claude/skills/`, available as slash commands
   - **OpenAI Codex** — Skills in `codex/skills/` with `AGENTS.md` references
   - **Cursor** — Skills as rule files in `.cursor/rules/`
   - **Antigravity** — Skills in `.antigravity/skills/`

4. **Documentation Overhaul** — Developer guide (EN + ZH) rewritten with:
   - Platform-specific installation prompts
   - Detailed skill reference with real-world usage examples
   - Workflow diagrams showing how the three core skills work together
   - Upload guide clarified: ZIP must contain a root folder, body is base64-encoded
